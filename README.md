# Pure360 Weather Test

What's the weather in Brighton? You tell me!

The purpose of this task is to:

* Make a call to `/api/overview.json` for the weeks weather in Brighton
* Output the weeks weather
* Allow the user to drill in to a days weather (This can pull back `today.json`)
* Your code should be covered by Unit tests

## Run

To start the node server use `npm start` - an optional port can be passed
with `port=3001 npm start`

## Run the tests

Run all tests with `npm run test-single-run` or watch over the tests with
`npm test`

Happy coding :dancer:
